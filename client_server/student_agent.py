"""
Student Agent Implementation for River and Stones Game

This file contains the essential utilities and template for implementing your AI agent.
Your task is to complete the StudentAgent class with intelligent move selection.

Game Rules:
- Goal: Get 4 of your stones into the opponent's scoring area
- Pieces can be stones or rivers (horizontal/vertical orientation)  
- Actions: move, push, flip (stone↔river), rotate (river orientation)
- Rivers enable flow-based movement across the board

Your Task:
Implement the choose() method in the StudentAgent class to select optimal moves.
You may add any helper methods and modify the evaluation function as needed.
